# Oxidize JSON

How Would It Work?
Extract Schema from Example JSONs

Parse multiple JSON examples.
Determine common structures, types, and constraints.
Generate a JSON Schema dynamically.
Validate Future JSONs Against This Schema

Use Rust’s jsonschema crate to check new JSONs against the dynamically created schema.
Optional Features

CLI/REST API to accept example JSONs and return the inferred schema.
Ability to fine-tune inferred schemas (e.g., manually specifying required fields, constraints).
Integration with Flatfile or other ETL pipelines for validating incoming JSON data.
Does It Make Sense to Build This?
✅ Yes, because:

Many systems require JSON validation but don't always have predefined schemas.
This tool can be useful in data ingestion pipelines (e.g., Flatfile, APIs).
Rust's performance ensures it scales well for large JSON datasets.
It showcases Rust’s memory safety, performance, and strong JSON processing capabilities.
⚠ Challenges:

Inferring schemas from JSON examples isn't always straightforward (e.g., handling optional fields).
Defining how strict the validation should be (e.g., should a missing field fail validation?).

Rust’s strong JSON processing (serde_json, jsonschema).
Performance advantages over Python/Node.js for similar tasks.
Practicality—this tool could actually be used in real-world data pipelines.
